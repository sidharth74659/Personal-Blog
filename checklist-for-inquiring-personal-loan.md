### **Checklist for Inquiring About a Personal Loan (Not Home/Vehicle Loans)**

When exploring personal loan options, use this checklist to gather and compare essential details. Make sure to cross-check this information online or through trusted contacts so you don’t miss anything important.

### **Bank Details**
- **Bank Name:**  
- **Branch:**  
- **Contact Number (Loan Officer/Bank Rep):**

  - If yes, that's a plus!  
  - If not, you’ll want to have this checklist handy—it’ll help smooth out the process.

### **Loan Information**
- **Loan Amount (Principal - P):**  
- **Tenure (T - in months or years):**  
- **Interest Rate (R - in %):**  
- **Interest Calculation Formula:**  
  - Most follow a standard EMI formula, but it’s helpful to know for calculating against different tenures or scenarios.

- **Processing Fee:**  
  Two types to be aware of:  
  1. A standard processing charge by the bank (or mediator), often separate from the loan amount.
  2. A deduction from your sanctioned amount (e.g., if sanctioned ₹10L, you might receive ~₹9.88L after GST + processing charges).

- **Loan Type:** Fixed or Variable  
  - *Note: Variable rates may fluctuate over time.*

- **Foreclosure Details:**  
  - *When can you foreclose?* (Usually starts after 12 months)  
  - *Foreclosure Charges:* Typically 3–4%, though some banks offer zero charges—be sure to confirm both points.

- **EMI Breakdown / EMI Calculator Table:**  
  - Ask for a monthly breakdown of payments.  
  - Also, check how much total interest you’d save if you foreclose early(*you can use the formula*).

- **Total Interest Payable:**  
  - The amount paid **in addition** to your principal.

- **Total Repayment Amount:**  
  - Principal + Total Interest (Full amount you'll repay)

- **Insurance Details:**  
  - Check whether loan protection insurance is bundled or optional, and what it covers.

- **Other Charges:**  
  - E.g., prepayment penalties, account maintenance, documentation, etc.

- **Commission (if any):**  
  - Only discuss this if the bank(or mediator) brings it up.

### **Tips:**
- Start with **SBI**, then check **HDFC**, and move to other banks if needed.  
- I highly recommended Visiting the branch in person(for the first time) for a complete understanding—calls usually don’t give you the full picture. Once you understand the process, you can manage further discussions over the phone with any bank.
- **If your company isn’t listed**, they usually look into **NBFCs** (Non-Banking Financial Companies) like Bajaj Finance—but note that interest rates and other charges tend to be higher.  
- **Pro Tip:** Inquiring at one bank often triggers offers from others—use that to your advantage!
