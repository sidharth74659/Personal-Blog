### Summaries

(Sep 1st) [How to say "No" and win back your time as a software engineer](https://read.highgrowthengineer.com/p/how-to-say-no-and-win-back-your-time)

- @person has to ruthlessly prioritize the most impactful and relevant work. At the same time, there are constant stakeholders pulling for his time and attention. [More](https://substack.com/@jordancutler/p-147346238?utm_source=pointerio.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=issue-541#:~:text=has%20to%20ruthlessly%20prioritize%20the%20most%20impactful%20and%20relevant)
- Average Day includes:
	- working on projects, schedule/attend meetings, and help others out

As software engineers, we’re often asked to take on many responsibilities in addition to writing code. We have to scope projects, go to meetings, and help others out. But by doing too much, we lose our focus.

To be impactful, we have to focus. We have to say no. Let’s see how.

- The Direct Approach:
	- Politely decline, ~~Thank them for considering you~~, Express/show interest
	- `Unfortunately I’m not able to take this on as my plate is currently full, but thank you for the opportunity. Would love to see updates though`
	- `Unfortunately, I’m not able to. My plate is completely full, but thanks for thinking of me. I’d love to keep up with how it progresses though. Any way for me to stay in the loop?`
- The Redirect Approach:
	- redirect to someone else who’s better suited to answer the question
	- `Have you tried asking Judy? She nows this area pretty well.`
	- Do follow up
- Change Their Perspective Approach:
	- ensure they drive the resolution independently
	- Provide general direction when guiding them, Do not promise to help all the way
	- `I know this might be different from what you’re asking, but have you considered trying this <insert path> instead?`
- The Stonewall Approach:
	- Last resort approach
	- _ignore the messages_
	- If you want, you can also take a day or two to respond. You can say, `So sorry I missed this. The last couple of days have been hectic. Are you still working through this?`. From experience, by that time, they’ve already figured it out.

#### Interesting Code Snippets:

- [URIError: decoding the encoded](https://raygun.com/blog/top-6-javascript-errors/#:~:text=URIError%3A%20decoding%20the%20encoded)
	- I like how in the code, If a `URIError` occurs, it returns the original string. For other errors, it *rethrows* them to avoid silent failures.
- [A good example of using Guard Clauses](https://clerk.com/blog/add-onboarding-flow-for-your-application-with-clerk?utm_source=pointer.io&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=onboarding-flow&utm_content=09-13-24#:~:text=Add%20the-,code%20sample,-below%20to%20your)
