# How to Export and Import Copilot Chat Sessions in Visual Studio Code


In this post, we'll walk you through the process of exporting and importing your chat sessions in Visual Studio Code. This can be particularly useful for keeping track of your conversations or sharing insights with others.

## Step 1: Exporting Your Chat Session

To export a Copilot Chat session, simply follow these steps:
1. Open Visual Studio Code.
2. Use the command palette by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P`.
3. Type and select `Chat: Export Session...` or navigate through the menu by choosing `View > Command Palette > Chat: Export Session...`.

This will save your chat session as a JSON file, which you can easily manage and share.  

*Note*: You can also *import* by following the **Step 1** but select `Chat: Import Session...` (not sure about the use-case though).

## Step 2: Extracting Chat Details

Once you have your JSON content ready, you can use the following JavaScript function to extract the details from your chat session:

```js
const jsonContent = {}; // Placeholder for your chat JSON content

function extractChatDetails(jsonContent) {
  const outputArray = jsonContent.requests.map(request => {
    const question = request.message.parts[0].text;
    const answer = request.response[0].value;

    return generateQuestionAnswerTemplate(question, answer);
  });

  return outputArray.join('');
}

function generateQuestionAnswerTemplate(question, answer) {
  return `##### Question: \n\`\`\`\n${question}\n\`\`\`\n\n**Answer**:\n${answer}\n\n---\n`;
}

const extractedText = extractChatDetails(jsonContent);
copy(extractedText); // Copied to clipboard, paste it in Obsidian(as markdown)
```

*Note:*
You can refer to the discussion [here](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/57190#discussioncomment-6594103), which also contains *Python* and *Bash* scripts, in the comments, the above example is based on *JavaScript* for execution in the browser's developer tools.
- It can also be adapted into a *Node.js* application if needed.
