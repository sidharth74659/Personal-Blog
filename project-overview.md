_Note_:
- The list is not sorted by priority; it will be decided upon discussion.
- The document divided into three phases, each spanning 2-3 weeks of development depending on resources and goals:

---
## Phase 1: MVP Version: Essential Foundation

The MVP version should focus on establishing core functionality while maintaining simplicity and usability. 

- [-] **Basic drag-and-drop interface** allowing users to visually construct forms without coding knowledge.
- [-]  **Component library** would feature essential form elements including single-line and multi-line text inputs,
	- [ ] selection components (drop downs, radio buttons, checkboxes), 
- [-] Required **basic field-level validation**, placeholder text, and help text. 
	- [ ] Simple *conditional logic* would allow hiding or showing fields based on user inputs
	- [ ] number inputs with *basic validation* constraints, and date/time pickers with *format options*.
- [-] **JSON-based form schema** for backend flexibility: The builder would generate standardized form definitions in *JSON format*, facilitating easy storage and retrieval from databases.
- [-] Instant form preview and testing capabilities.
- [ ] **Form and Project Management**: allowing users to organize, track, and manage their forms, and projects.
- [ ] **Responsiveness** is a priority even in this initial version, with the form renderer automatically adjusting layouts for different screen sizes.
- [ ] Basic **theming capabilities** would allow customization of colors, fonts, and styles to match organizational branding.
	- [ ] Build a *debug-tool* similar to `config-mode` allowing one to experiment for custom themes. (form styling options with customizable themes)
- [ ] **Form submission storage and retrieval**: Support form submission to webhooks or custom API endpoints, enabling connection with existing backend systems.
	- [ ] Straightforward submission process with confirmation messages.
	- [ ] REST API endpoints for form creation and submission.
	- [ ] Webhook support for connecting with external systems.
	- [ ] Simple data export functionality (CSV, JSON formats)
- [ ] **User management** would include basic role-based permissions, distinguishing between form creators, editors, and form users.
	- [ ] Basic authentication mechanisms for form access.
	- [ ] Team-based access controls and permissions.
- [ ] **Analytics** would be limited to submission counting and basic success/failure tracking. This foundation would provide immediate value while setting the stage for more advanced features in subsequent versions.
- [ ] (discussion) Translation
- [ ] (discussion) **PDF Export Functionality**: allow users to export forms as PDF documents, particularly useful for archiving, sharing or printing forms.
	- [ ] possibly allow customizing the PDF, watermarks, and adding custom styles.
- [ ] Simple **form sharing** via generated links
	- [ ] JavaScript interfaces for embedding forms in websites and applications.

## Phase 2: Enhanced Components and Integration

Building upon the MVP, Phase 2, would significantly expand both the component library and integration capabilities.

- [ ] The component set would grow to include **specialized component elements** such as:
	- [ ] file uploads with validation and preview functionality, signature capture fields, rating components (stars, sliders), geolocation fields with map integration, and matrix/grid questions for tabular data collection.
	- [ ] Reusable form templates and component libraries
- [ ] **Validation rules** would become more sophisticated:
	- [ ] supporting *regular expression patterns*, *cross-field validation* (comparing values between multiple fields: confirm password, if needed), and *conditional validation logic*. 
	- [ ] (discussion) Form designers would gain access to a rule builder interface for creating complex validation scenarios without writing code.
- [ ] **Multi-page form** support would be a central feature of this version, allowing the creation of form wizards with progress tracking and conditional navigation paths.
- [ ] **Drafts/Versioning**: Users could save partial progress and resume form completion later, with appropriate security measures protecting in-progress submissions.
	- [ ] Form version history and ~~comparison tools~~
- [ ] Direct integrations with common business/backend systems: Include **pre-built connectors** for popular services like CRM systems, email marketing platforms, database systems, and document storage services.
	- [ ] A visual data mapping interface would allow administrators to configure how form data maps to external system fields without writing integration code.
	- [ ] Custom endpoint support for specialized systems.
- [ ] Template library featuring **pre-designed forms** for common use cases, significantly accelerating development time.
- [ ] (discussion) Enhanced collaboration features would **support team-based form development** with **version tracking and editing notifications**.
- [ ] (discussion) **Analysis and reporting tools** would provide insights into form *usage patterns*, *completion rates*, and submission trends through visual dashboards.

## Phase 3: Enterprise-Grade Solution

The final evolution would transform the custom form builder into a comprehensive enterprise solution comparable to specialized platforms like **Form.io** and **Miratasoft.com**, but tailored to specific organizational needs.

- [ ] Dynamic conditions would support complex **multi-level logic** with nested AND/OR operators and formula calculations between fields, enabling sophisticated business rule implementation.
- [ ] Allow forms to **fetch data from external APIs** in real-time, **pre-populate fields**, **validate against external data sources**, and **synchronize bi-directionally with other systems**. This would enable scenarios like customer information auto-completion, product availability checking, and integrated business workflows.
- [ ] Framework for **creating new custom components** without starting from scratch(by extending existing components).
	- [ ] Organizations could build specialized components for unique business processes while maintaining consistency with the core system.
	- [ ] Developers would have access to event hooks and a JavaScript API for programmatic form control when needed.
	- [ ] Basically, Support code-level changes to enable adding custom styles, custom JavaScript, and extending existing form controls for custom components tailored to specific needs.
- [ ] (discussion) **Security features** would expand to address enterprise requirements, including end-to-end encryption for sensitive data, compliance with global security standards(OWASP), compliance tools for regulations like GDPR and HIPAA, comprehensive audit logging, and fine-grained access controls.
- [ ] Offline capabilities would be enhanced to support complete form operations without connectivity, with intelligent conflict resolution during synchronization.
	- [ ] Offline data collection with synchronization when back online
- [ ] Collaboration features would support **real-time co-editing** with visual indicators of other editors' activities.
- [ ] **Workflow capabilities** would include approval processes, role-based reviews, commenting, and automated notifications.
	- [ ] Multi-step form workflows for complex processes.
	- [ ] Submission review and approval workflows.
	- [ ] (list) Basic workflow automations.
- [ ] The platform would also incorporate **AI-assisted features** such as form design recommendations, automated field recognition from existing documents, and anomaly detection in form submissions.
- [ ] **Comments and Feedback Mechanisms**: Implement a robust system for collecting user feedback and comments directly within forms. This feature would facilitate real-time communication and *continuous improvement based* on user input.
- [ ] **Containerization with Docker**: Package the form builder into Docker containers to simplify deployment, scaling, and management across different environments, ensuring consistency and ease of maintenance.
- [ ] **White-labeling and Comprehensive Customization Options**: Offer extensive customization capabilities to allow organizations to brand and tailor the form builder to their specific needs, enhancing user experience and brand alignment.
- [ ] **High-Volume Submission Handling and Performance Optimization**: Scale the system to handle high volumes of form submissions efficiently, optimizing performance to manage increased load and ensuring reliability during peak usage times.
- [ ] **Developer SDK for Extending Functionality**: Provide a software development kit that enables developers to create custom extensions and integrations, fostering an ecosystem of add-ons that enhance and expand the form builder's capabilities.
- [ ] **Dashboard**: A dashboard for managing forms, submissions, and users(also something like JIRA with issue tracking, etc.).
